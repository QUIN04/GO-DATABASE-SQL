**DATABASE ANALYSIS FOR AN EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**

An **Employee Management System (EMS)** is a software solution that helps organizations manage employee information and HR processes efficiently. It centralizes employee data, automates tasks, and improves overall HR operations.

An **EER diagram** is a graphical representation of a database schema, showing entities, attributes, and relationships between them. It's an extension of the ER model, incorporating additional features like specialization, generalization, and aggregation.

Based on the ER Diagram, we can identify the following entities and relationships:

**Entities:**
USERS: Represents users of the system, including employees and administrators.
EMPLOYEES: Represents employees of the company.
DEPARTMENTS: Represents departments within the company.
ATTENDANCE: Represents employee attendance records.
PAYSLIPS: Represents employee payslips.
ROLES: Represents different roles within the system (e.g., employee, administrator).
ADMINISTRATORS: Represents administrators of the system.

**Relationships:**
USERS has a one-to-one relationship with EMPLOYEES.
EMPLOYEES has a one-to-many relationship with ATTENDANCE.
EMPLOYEES has a one-to-many relationship with PAYSLIPS.
EMPLOYEES belongs to one DEPARTMENT.
DEPARTMENTS has many EMPLOYEES.
USERS has a one-to-many relationship with ROLES.
ROLES has many USERS.
ADMINISTRATORS is a subset of USERS.
ADMINISTRATORS has a one-to-one relationship with ROLES.
